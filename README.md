Why Do Doctors Recommend Fluconazole for Fungal Infections?
Fluconazole is a widely trusted antifungal medication used to treat a range of infections, including vaginal yeast infections, oral thrush (candidiasis), and systemic fungal conditions. It works by disrupting the fungal cell membrane, effectively stopping the growth and spread of infection. With its proven efficacy and flexible dosing, Fluconazole is a go-to choice for both doctors and patients.
